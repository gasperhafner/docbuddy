Press release
Laundryheap Unveils Enhanced In-House Driver App to Optimize Delivery Operations
London, 19th Dec – Laundryheap, a leading provider of on-demand laundry services, is excited to announce a major update to its driver app, transitioning from the existing Onfleet platform to a robust in-house solution built from the ground up. This strategic move aims to overcome limitations observed in the previous system, providing an enhanced user experience for drivers while maintaining and expanding essential functionalities.
Key Enhancements:
Easier Navigation: The revamped user flow within the new app allows drivers to seamlessly navigate through open and booked blocks, view assigned tasks for the day, and activate, complete, or fail tasks—all within a unified platform. The improved user interface ensures a more intuitive experience, facilitating efficient tracking of driver touchpoints for the team.
Relevant Information: The task list in the new app communicates crucial details such as order number, customer address, service type (pickup or delivery), task timeslot, and estimated time of arrival (ETA) for the next task. Push and in-app notifications keep drivers informed of any changes to the active route or task, allowing ample time for adjustments.
Navigation Excellence: Introducing an in-app navigation system, the new app enables drivers to view routes without leaving the application. Leveraging the Google Maps API for real-time traffic data, road closures, and one-way streets, the updated navigation system offers increased accuracy. Visual indicators in the task list highlight concurrent tasks at the same location, prioritizing deliveries to optimize efficiency and reduce errors.
Quality of Life Improvements: The task navigator has been meticulously designed with ease of use in mind, aiming to enhance the day-to-day operations of drivers. Sequencing tasks to prioritize deliveries minimizes the need for drivers to shuttle back and forth to their vehicles, streamlining the overall process. Visual communication regarding the number of bags and hangers for each delivery further contributes to a more seamless workflow.
Mr. Deyan Dimitrov, CEO and Founder of Laundryheap, expressed his enthusiasm for the app update, stating, "Our commitment to providing top-notch services extends beyond our customers to our valued drivers. This in-house app is a testament to our dedication to their success, offering a user-friendly and feature-rich platform that simplifies their daily tasks and enhances overall efficiency."
Laundryheap remains at the forefront of innovation in the on-demand laundry industry, continually striving to elevate both customer and driver experiences. The updated in-house driver app is set to roll out in early 2024 and is poised to make a significant impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of Laundryheap's delivery operations.

Key challenges

Replace Onfleet’s app with our own while improving driver experience and efficiency (Task list + What step to start the task)
From Piyash Pal: What do you mean by “Task list”? - A Task list is a general list of all the tasks that are assigned to a driver within a single route. It consists of both pickups and dropoffs
↳ From Piyash Pal: How many tasks are we showing in this task list? Do we intend to hide all future tasks while still providing some info about concurrent tasks? Peter Cernuta Kushagra Rawat - We want to show the entire task list and decide on what info each task card will show
↳ Understood, let’s progress on this a bit more. I remember Caroline saying on the call too that she wouldn’t want to show the entire task list. What are their reasons for saying? 
From Piyash Pal: “Efficiency” of? What is the goal of this? - Efficiency of the route planning process, where in we plan a route for a driver but they don’t end up rejecting the route at once
↳ From Piyash Pal: What do you mean by “rejecting route at once” is there a functionality like such in onfleet? - No such functionality but an operational issue. Driver receives the route and communicates to the admin team that they don’t want to do this route or they suggest improvements to the route (usually changing sequence of tasks)
↳ Based on the driver interviews we did yesterday, I think this is because they ask for: 1. Flexibility in choosing the sequence of tasks based on the traffic | 2. Ability to effectively do more tasks | 3. Anything else?
Driver should no longer see the full route but only the next task (Need to design this) - Not feasible , we will show complete task list 
From Piyash Pal: “full route” usually comprises all the customer/facility pickup/dropoffs, right? How would this “full route” update if there was a task which was withdrawn or a schedule update? Can you please tell me? - If there is task that was withdrawn/cancelled or rescheduled, it would be removed/resequenced in the task list and shown to the driver as such. You cannot withdraw or reschedule and active task
↳ But if we are not showing the task list then this does not even make sense.- Guess we know now 
Last-minute changes to tasks (reschedules, updated driver instructions, updated methods) should be reflected in the app immediately, perhaps along with a push notification
From Piyash Pal: Let’s say the driver has 14 tasks, are we going to only reflect changes for immediate tasks with an in-app notification WHEN it is driver instructions/collect or deliver method - What do you mean by immediate tasks?
↳ By immediate I mean Active task or (Active task + 1; Next task): Drivers usually look at the driver instructions on onfleet so I don’t think notifications for non-active tasks is so important in v1 but something for v2
From Piyash Pal: Because I don’t think it’s relevant for the driver when it is a task which is 2nd in line from the active task THAT has been rescheduled - I do think it is relevant for the driver to know that a non active task has been rescheduled and onfleet sends some notification regarding the same. We should also retain this functionality.
↳ We need to be mindful cause I still need why the operations team don’t want to show the whole list of tasks. This will define if we need to notify the drivers for any reschedule for later tasks. I have a few more questions on this also.
From Piyash Pal: What happens when an active task is rescheduled/cancelled? - Active task cannot be rescheduled without failing the task from either the driver or admin end. In this case, the task is failed + order status → pending and the date of the task is rescheduled in the backend
↳ So it won’t show up any more on the screen or in the task list and basically, the driver can get a notification depending on what went wrong - Driver will usually contact logs team in such cases as these reasons are few and far (driver arrived early and customer not at home, vehicle breakdown to name a few)
From Piyash Pal: The same questions are applied to the following pointer (concurrent pickup/dropoffs
Solve the issue of concurrent pickups (=pickups of multiple orders at the same location, ie a hotel, to avoid mixups of bags) - How should we group these orders and display them to the driver
From Piyash Pal: Ideally these can be pickups and dropoffs only or both, correct? - correct
From Piyash Pal: Let's figure out what the best method for the driver is to do when it comes to both pickup and dropoff. Like we notify the driver that it is a mix of both and ask them to only carry the dropoff items first. But in case the customer is not at the “hotel/society” we should encourage the customers to use the “...outside the door” method. Thoughts? - Agreed, In dubai we’ve tried “collect outside the door” option as default but in hotels they don’t allow our PDs past the reception and customer anyway has to come to the reception
Driver does not want to do longer routes because they plan their day around the route that they are given and hence visibility of entire route is important to them
From Piyash Pal: Didn’t you say “full route” should not be shown? This is more of a logistical question. Should admins/lmfs be providing an optimal route - True, this is more of an operational issue but let’s see if we can solve for at least the visibility part in some way
↳ What do you mean by “visibility”? Can you please elaborate? - By visibility i meant the kind of info and functionality we want to show to the driver and the discoverability of said functions
We want to ensure that drivers do not start a task out of order in the task sequence for the route assigned to them - 
Logs team want to know the driver location even before the shift begins so that the team can get a visibility into whether the driver will be able to make it to Facility on time for shift


FAQ
What is the default landing page when a user opens the app
Default Landing Page
Driver opens app before starting shift 
Before task list is sent (> 60 mins to block start time)
Block page: My blocks + open blocks
After task list is sent (< 60 mins to block start time)
Block page with task list CTA
Driver opens app during a shift (activated a WP/FP task): Always land on task list- to ensure driver remains inside task list flow
What happens to the completed tasks and how do we show them on the task list?
When can a driver start a task?
Use the same logic as we currently follow on the onfleet driver app
Why do we need task history? Where do we show the task history? What should it look like? 
Payment reasons - I did these many tasks and need to be paid as such 
Reconciliation - If some issue happened with an order, driver will go back to task history and check for the task in the history
We will show task history as a separate tab in the hamburger menu
Search Bar - How does it work and what all can you search there? Search by customer name, address and order number? What else?
Do we need an option for a driver to go off duty in the middle of the shift? What could be the reason for the same? - We don’t really need them going offline but we do need a way to track them before their shift begins so we can track their exact location.
What inapp notifications should we provide for driver - 
Running late 
Task added 
Task removed 
Offline/Online Status (due to network issues)
Should we provide the driver with an option to visualize complete route (suggested by Peter and I’m sure the logs team will also ask for it since it was already there in onfleet) - Yes we should 
Drivers sometimes only look at the task slot and then idle till the task time (for example, driver will look at task and see first task is at 7pm without realising it’s a drop at door/reception)
Some drivers don’t have blocks and block scheduler (for example - Gulf Countries), what do we show here?
Take them directly to the task list when they open the app
What happens when the admin team adds a facility pickup in the middle of a shift
It will be marked as a facility pickup and be added in the middle of the route
What happens if the task is Active and the driver closes the app - 
Mobile App - Always open block scheduler 
Push notifications - When the driver has an upcoming block in the next couple of hours, we send a push notification “You have an upcoming block” 
2 hrs from block start time + Block is accepted/taken: We will send a notification
Click on notification → Open My Blocks page
Block Status will say “Upcoming” 
When should the driver be able to call and text the customer 
When a driver has a current task, they should see an option to call and text the customer 
For multiple tasks in the same location, how will we display the markers in the bird's eye view?  
If pickup and drop in a sequence 
PICK, DROP
#3, #4
Check for French Translations here (Pick up: Ramasser | Drop off: Déposer)
Are we showing Facility/Warehouse tasks on the map view? - No, we only need to show customer tasks

Block Labels 

Each block can have different block status and we use different tags to communicate the same with customer 

Block Status → Open 
Block List Tag → Open 
Block Details Banner → Banner says “Open Block”

When to show? 
Upcoming - 2 hours before block start time uptil the block start time 
Pending - When admin team assigns a block to driver for him to accept or reject
Taken by Me - When driver confirms a block which he picked or was assigned + when block is past start time but first task not active 
Open - Open block which is available for picking
Active - When the first task in a block is activated, we mark the block as active until the current active task ETC (estimated time of completion) is within the block timings 

All the labels on the block list will be displayed on block details as well

[Rules for CTA buttons]
If there are any blocks → show go to task list 

If there are any tasks with status Active → Show go to navigation 

If there are no blocks → Don’t show anything

Objective
To increase % of orders with a review from current 8% to at least 30% while ensuring quality, actionable feedback.

How do we ensure an increased review volume?
Strategic timing of reviews
Smart use of push notifications and emails, including reminders
Reduce friction
Capture data points as soon as available (save each step so we don’t lose data if user drops off halfway through)
Offer a reward for a comprehensive  review (this will be added later when we have credits in place)

How do we ensure the feedback is actionable?

Ask for driver feedback at the collection
Ask for service feedback at delivery
Ensure appropriate delays before prompting, based on whether the interaction is personal or not
Offer relevant pills, depending on whether the interaction is personal or not

Details
Rate the collection
Order status cards
After collection is successfully completed, the order status card displays the message “Please help our drivers improve by leaving feedback”. The order detail card displays a CTA “Review collection”. These elements remain on the cards for statuses “On the way to facility” and “At the facility”, unless the collection has already been rated.
Shipment tracking
If viewed from the mobile app webview, there is no need to add anything because the bottom sheet from the mobile app will pop up as described below.
If viewed from a browser, an additional component with the star rating is shown immediately as per design.
Emails
We already send a “bag receipt” email when a collection is completed. That email will now include a component with star rating as per design. The component must contain a universal link that opens the mobile app and starts the review process if the app is installed, else it opens the webapp. The link to the webapp must allow the user to rate even if they’re not previously logged into the webapp.
Mobile app bottom sheet
The bottom sheet is eligible to appear +5min after the collection time (24h if collection from outside or reception) and up to the time when order is collected from the facility. Bottom sheet can either be dismissed forever (for this collection) or postponed by 24h. If postponed beyond the time when order is collected from the facility, or if already reviewed, then the sheet is no longer eligible to appear
Mobile app push notification
The push notification is sent +5min after the collection time (24h if collection from outside or reception). If tapped, the user is taken straight into the review process. If the bottom sheet was postponed by 24h, the push notification is also repeated after 24h, unless the bottom sheet is no longer eligible to appear as per previous paragraph.
Web app modal popup
We do not pop any review modals in the web app. Customers must click on the order status card button or the email (above) to start the review process.

Rate the delivery
Order status cards
After delivery is successfully completed, the order status card displays the message “Help us by giving feedback”. The order detail card displays a CTA “Review our service”. These elements remain on the cards for statuses for 7 days, unless the service has already been rated.
Shipment tracking
If viewed from the mobile app webview, there is no need to add anything because the bottom sheet from the mobile app will pop up as described earlier.
If viewed from a browser, an additional component with the star rating is shown immediately as per design.
Emails
“Review our service” email is sent 2h after successful personal delivery (24h if collection from outside or reception). The email is sent only once per order, after first successful delivery, in case there are multiple deliveries.  The component must contain a universal link that opens the mobile app and starts the review process if the app is installed, else it opens the webapp. The link to the webapp must allow the user to rate even if they’re not previously logged into the webapp.
Mobile app bottom sheet
The bottom sheet is eligible to appear 24h after the delivery time (48h if delivery from outside or reception) and up to 7 days later. Bottom sheet can either be dismissed forever (for this delivery) or postponed by 24h. If postponed beyond 7 days, or if already reviewed, then the sheet is no longer eligible to appear.
Mobile app push notification
The push notification is sent 24h after the delivery time (48h if delivery from outside or reception). If tapped, the user is taken straight into the review process. If the bottom sheet was postponed by 24h, the push notification is also repeated after 24h, unless the bottom sheet is no longer eligible to appear as per previous paragraph.
Web app modal popup
We do not pop any review modals in the web app. Customers must click on the order status card button or the email (above) to start the review process.
Review process & backend considerations
We must save data at every step (rating, pills, text area), so if a customer only rates the stars but then doesn’t proceed we at least have the star rating.
The old review options configurator should be removed to avoid confusion.
The review schema should be compatible with the old one (star rating, pills, text area). Please ensure the mapping remains the same and that downstream functionality is unaffected (Slack notifications for bad reviews, Intercom/customer.io events, BO review pages, …)
Frontend considerations
We’ll use Lottie for the thank you animation.
Tapping/clicking on stars triggers an on/press state, briefly showing the selected stars as confirmation before moving to the next stage.ange 
Ignore the credits placeholder box for now.
Both mobile app and webapp should send the following Posthog and UXcam events
Driver review:
driver_review_started
driver_review_stars_submitted (event property stars = [1-5])
driver_review_pills_submitted
driver_review_comment_submitted (this is effectively when the review is fully complete)
driver_review_remind_later (when user taps “remind later”)
Service review:
service_review_started
service_review_stars_submitted (event property stars = [1-5])
service_review_pills_submitted
service_review_comment_submitted (this is effectively when the review is fully complete)
service_review_remind_later (when user taps “remind later”)

RA only affects the order status cards in that a different CTA is shown. RA indeed should have a priority over the review as discussed. But that should not affected the push notifications or emails - if use clicks on the email link to review or push notification, they should be able to leave a review regardless of whether a RA response is needed or not


Pills should be editable via database. The old review options configurator should be removed to avoid confusion.

List of pills are now hardcoded and can be changed with additional commit. Can I leave it as it is?
Yes

The review schema should be compatible with the old one (star rating, pills, text area). Please ensure the mapping remains the same and that downstream functionality is unaffected (Slack notifications for bad reviews, Intercom/customer.io events, BO review pages, …)

In current driver review process customer sends a review in one step. We have all information (star, review option, additional comment) and if score is <= 3 and if any selected option has customer comment we send slack notification with all the data. 

In new flow customer first sends score, then optional review options and later optional additional comment. We can send slack notification immediately but this means we won’t have reviewed options and additional comments OR I can schedule a job which will send slack notification x minute later assuming customer will finish with the driver review (reviewed options, additional comment)
Yes let's schedule a job to send the review notification 30min later with all the details we have at that point.

When do we automatically show bottom sheet on mobie app? Do i show it on every screen that lists the orders(dashboard, resolution center, past orders) and on order details screens? Or any other as well?
We agreed that you show these where data is readily available - no need to make additional API calls on every single screen





Panic mode
Laundryheap is down… what to do?!

These instructions are only if the backend stopped working. If the backend stopped working, mobile, web app, admin, etc., all stop working. 


	
 What to do (If I am not Slaven, Gašper or Andraž)?
Call them first
Chuck Norris 114
Slaven Stančič - 041 810 164
Gašper Hafner - 040 211 938
Andraž Trošt - 040 350 966
If you don’t have access to AWS, then just let everybody know via #laundryheap channel that site is not working and there is nothing else for you to do, but if you have access to AWS proceed with instructions
Write to #laundryheap channel that you will be rebooting a server
Reboot the whole machine using AWS Console, make sure you are using “eu-west-1 Ireland” region

Check if site is working and let others on #laundryheap channel know that everything is fine now, or that it still does not work after restart
Even if the site is still not working, there is nothing else for you to do



What to do (If I am Slaven, Gašper or Andraž)?
You can still follow the above instructions, but you already knew that didn’t you?! 🙂

We will cover the most common scenarios. When you SSH to the server now, you get a status of all services and a list of useful commands that can help you with debugging. 

Usual culprits (in order of probability):
All resources are used (CPU usage on server at 100% or CPU usage on database server at 100% or memory usage at 100% …)
Faulty deploy (someone just deployed unworking version and went for lunch)
Anything else

All resources are used
Check DataDog if CPU is at 100%, if CPU on database or app server is at 100% this is probably the reason why site is not responding
If it’s app server CPU that is at 100%, either wait or restart services using “lh-restart-all” or restart the whole server using AWS console

Faulty deploy
Connect to VPN
SSH to production server
“lh-list-releases” will show you last 5 releases
“lh-set-release” will set the release to the one you specify (it will change the link to the correct directory and also restart puma, sidekiq, sidekiq-sheet)


Anything else
Check if all services are running with “lh-status-quick-all”
You can restart all services using “lh-restart-all” or “lh-restart”
If a service is not running, or keeps restarting check log with “sudo journalctl -u [service] -S -2hr”




Create instance from snapshot (Only if I am Slaven, Gašper or Andraž)
If everything else fails, you can try to recreate an instance from a daily snapshot.

Shutdown the server that is not working
List AWS EC2 AMI images by date of creation

Launch instances from AMI that you selected
Give it a name - same name as before + current date
Choose same instance type as it was before (you can check this on list of EC2 instances)
Choose key pair - andraz.trost@dlabs.si
Select existing security groups (check which ones are currently used by the instance you are trying to recreate and use the same) Be careful to really choose the same ones, there are some with very similar names!
Leave all other settings as they are by default
Lunch instance
Change elastic IP to point to new instance instead, this will make it possible to connect to instance via SSH using the same configuration as before and it will also mean deploys with CircleCI will go to this instance from now on
First disassociate elastic IP from current instance (AWS instructions)

Associate elastic IP to new instance (AWS instructions)

Check if SSH works and all services are started (it will probably give you a warning when you try to connect, you can fix this with “ssh-keygen -R <IP of the server>”)
Add new instance to target group and remove the old instance from it, this will direct all traffic from load balancer to go to the new instance
First remove current instance from target group - deregister it (AWS instructions)

Add new instance to target group - register it (AWS instructions), first click Include is as pending below, then click Register pending targets
Check if site works
